Hello, my name is Jose Camino-Cantu, I am student at the Univerity of Michigan graduating May 2026.
I am majoring in Aerospace Engineering with minors in both Computer Science and Mathematics.
I intend to continue my education with a MSE in Aerospace Engineering with an expected graduation of May 2027.

My primary interests include aerodynamic analysis, aircraft design, and CFD, specifically with programming integration. 

This repository serves to share some of my personal projects and will continue to be updated.
