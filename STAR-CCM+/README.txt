This is a collection of CFD simulation performed on STAR-CCM+ completed September 2023 - December 2024

This simulations are all External, Steady, Gas, Flows with the mesh created with PBM and custom controls. 
In addition, I focused on prism layer creation workflow to achieve y+ ~= 1 across the entire aircraft.
I also performed Mesh Sensitivity studies to confirm sufficient mesh resolution. 
These simulations were used to verify the aircraft's Lift and Drag Coefficients at various angle of attacks.
